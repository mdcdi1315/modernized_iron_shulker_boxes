### Modernized Iron Shulker Boxes

Pretty much a fork of the [Iron Shulker Boxes](https://github.com/progwml6/ironshulkerboxes) mod,
now live on each major mod loader platform by using my BML mod library.

It is improved and more code-clean than the original implementation.

New features have also been now added! Play the mod to find them out!

Because this project is a fork of that one, this project has been licensed under the GNU GPL V3 license, and it will remain that way.

Currently, the mod is released for 1.21.1 only. Until V1 is reached, no other versions will be released until the mod is fully stabilized.
